          <p>Welcome time travelerâ€¦ </p>
          <p>
            Recently the Board of Time and Space has determined multiple instances of improper use of your traveling
            powers. In order to keep your powers you must fix the errors in time you have created. Once you have
            completed all 3 restorations, you will regain full use of your powers once again. In order to repair the
            timeline, you must choose the right answers to make the right changes to time. As of right now you are
            restricted to traveling to Ancient Times, the Middle Ages, and the 20th Century.
